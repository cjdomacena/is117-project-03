                                        The battle between the USA and Russia was the root case of the invention of the
                                        internet. On October 4, 1957 the Russians launched the first man-made satellite
                                        in

                                        J.C.R Licklider was an American psychologist and computer scientist In 1962,
                                        ARPA
                                        hired Licklider for IPTO (Information Processing Techniques Office). His idea
                                        was
                                        that computers will help us to easily share information through networks. The
                                        problem was that when you connect three terminals in different locations, one
                                        terminal can only talk to one terminal and not to both terminals.

                                        Dr. Leonard Kleinrock first introduced the Queueing Theory to network and
                                        communications systems. However, the process of resource sharing is still slow.
                                        To speed up the resource sharing between networks, Kleinrock implemented Demand
                                        Access (You don’t get it until you need it) and Distributed Control (No one
                                        switch or device should have the authority to control the network, instead All
                                        devices share the authority of functions of the network)

                                        Paul Baran was asked by ARPA to create a system to transfer information between
                                        computers. He introduced "Hot Potato Routing"
                                        Hot potato routing - a routing technique enabling packet routing without storing
                                        them in buffers. Instead, this technique continuously transfers data packets
                                        until they reach their destination without the packets having to wait or be
                                        stored in a buffer.

                                    <p>
                                        In 1969, two universities set up the first computer network to be the recipient
                                        of the first “node-to-node” network transmission through ARPAnet. The first
                                        computer was located in a research lab at UCLA, the second was at Stanford, and
                                        lastly was in MIT, which was the lab that is to send the messages to both
                                        universities. The computer at UCLA successfully received the first message
                                        “LOGIN”, and Stanford only received the note’s first two letters. However, this
                                        breakthrough opens up new ways of communicating through multiple computers. And
                                        by the end of 1969, all computer networks at all universities were connected.

                                    <p>
                                        A computer engineer Ray Tomlinson invented the first email program under
                                        ARPAnet’s network. The concept behind it is to have the ability to send simple
                                        messages to another person across the same network.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Ray Tomlinson made an obvious decision to pick the “@” symbol since it tells the
                                        user “at” what computer they are in.

                                        Since the birth of ARPAnet, the number of computer networks have exponentially
                                        grown. Number of computer networks have emerged like LAN (Local Area Network),
                                        it links computer networks in offices or buildings, and WANs (Wide Area
                                        Network), it links computer networks across office buildings or campuses. But,
                                        each new network speaks a different language like a foreign country. To solve
                                        this problem, internet protocol is introduced to make each network
                                        interconnected.

                                            <p>Robert Kahn, and Vinton Cerf proposed the idea of an internet protocol to
                                                help different networks to interconnect networks through what they
                                                called “Gateways” or known today as routers.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>TCP/IP governs communication among all computers on the network and
                                                dictates how information should be packaged and turned into packets.
                                                This allows us to easily interconnect different networks and send and
                                                receive information.

                                        A major milestone in technology came from the U.S government. President George
                                        H. W. Bush passed a law that takes the Web out of the government’s hands and
                                        makes it available to the public. This unleashed an unprecedented progress in
                                        the development of the internet.

                                        Tim Burners-Lee introduced the world wine web: an internet that was not simply a
                                        way to send files from one place to another but was itself a “web” of
                                        information that anyone on the internet could retrieve. As a result, it allows
                                        us to have the internet that we know today.
                                    </p>

                                        The first browser that allows the public to easily traverse the “web” of
                                        information on the internet. Mosaic allows users to have access to the internet
                                        and browse the internet by being user-friendly. From the conception of ARPAnet
                                        to the internet that we know today, it’s conception has been a huge part of our
                                        daily lives. It helped us to be interconnected to each other in the comfort in
                                        our own home. It is safe to say that the internet has been a driving force in
                                        the innovations in technology that we have today.
